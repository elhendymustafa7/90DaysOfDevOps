 As you have already installed docker in previous days tasks, now is the time to run Docker commands.

- Use the `docker run` command to start a new container and interact with it through the command line. [Hint: docker run hello-world]

```bash
docker run hello-world 
```

- Use the `docker inspect` command to view detailed information about a container or image.

- Use the `docker port` command to list the port mappings for a container.

- Use the `docker stats` command to view resource usage statistics for one or more containers.

- Use the `docker top` command to view the processes running inside a container.

- Use the `docker save` command to save an image to a tar archive.

- Use the `docker load` command to load an image from a tar archive.
