- DevOps:
      DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, 
      and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: 
      evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development 
      and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers 
      and compete more effectively in the market.

- Automation: is the use of technology to automate tasks that would otherwise be performed manually 

- Scaling:  Scaling is the process of changing the size of an object or group of objects. 
            This can be done by either increasing or decreasing the size, either proportionally or non-proportionally

- Infrastructure:  Cloud infrastructure is a combination of physical and virtual resources, such as servers, storage, networks, 
                   and services that are used to deliver cloud computing services. 
                   These resources are hosted in a secure data center and accessed over the internet. 
                   Cloud infrastructure is designed to provide an on-demand, pay-as-you-go service 
                   that can be scaled up or down to meet the changing needs of organizations.
